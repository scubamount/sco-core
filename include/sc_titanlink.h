 * sc_titanlink.h: the layout of the TitanLink channel, Local\SCO_titanlink.link (docs/ipc.md,
 * "Bridge layouts").
 *
 * MIT, unlike the rest of sco-core (GPL-3.0): this file is part of the interface exception named
 * in LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING.md, so the Titanfall 2 side of the bridge (a Northstar plugin in its
 * own repository) may include it. It has no sco-core dependency: plain C11 or C++20, freestanding
 * headers only, header-only.
 *
 * Both sides vendor this header from the published SDK: sc-offline's titanlink built-in (the
 * owner, which creates the channel) and the Northstar plugin (the peer, which opens it by name
 * with sc_ipc_attach and never creates it). TL_LAYOUT_VERSION is this header's version: the owner
 * writes it into sc_ipc_hdr.layout_version and the peer passes it to sc_ipc_attach, which refuses
 * a channel of another version (SC_IPC_MISMATCH). So both sides must be built from copies with
 * the same TL_LAYOUT_VERSION; any change to a struct, offset or constant below bumps it.
 *
 * The channel is an sco.ipc channel (sc_ipc.h): the 64-byte sc_ipc_hdr, then the blocks and rings
 * below at fixed offsets. Units: Titanfall's (inches; 39.37 per metre), Source angles (pitch,
 * yaw, roll in degrees, pitch positive looking down), z up. Strings are NUL-terminated within
 * their array; a reader cuts them at the array's end whatever the writer left there.
