/* sc_spatial.h: sc-offline's teleport.spatial service: where you are, and positions converted
 * between the game's zones. This header ships with the sco SDK; the service is published by the
 * Star Citizen game pack under the owner "game" (docs/game-services.md; before game pack 0.1.0,
 * by sc-offline's built-in "teleport" plugin, with the same table). The sc_ prefix marks a game or
 * product service: sco_ is reserved for host services.
 * To use it:
 *
 *   const sc_spatial_v1* sp = NULL;
 *   if (api->size > offsetof(sco_api, query_service) &&
 *       api->query_service(SC_SPATIAL_SERVICE_NAME, SC_SPATIAL_SERVICE_VERSION,
 *                          (const void**)&sp) == SCO_OK) { ... }
 *
 * Frames and units. Positions are metres, as doubles. A zone is one of the game's nested reference
 * frames (star system > planet > city or station > ship > room); "local" is a position in a zone's
 * own frame, the same frame the game, the spawn.entities service and spawn.txt use for an entity
 * standing in that zone. "World" is the game's root frame. Out at a planet's distance from the star
 * (1e11 m) a double holds a world position to about 1.5e-5 m, so prefer zone_to_zone between two
 * zones over going through world coordinates: it stops at their common ancestor.
 *
 * Ids. Zone and entity ids are the game's own 64-bit ids, opaque: never pointers. Zone id 0 names
 * the world frame in local_to_world, world_to_local and zone_to_zone. An id names something only
 * while it's streamed in; once it streams out the functions answer 0 for it.
 *
 * Every function returns 1 when it answered and 0 when it can't (wrong thread, you haven't
 * spawned, an id that isn't streamed in, a null pointer, teleport unavailable on this game build);
 * outputs are written only on 1. Game thread only (a command, a tick or a run_on_game_thread
 * task): every call reads the game afresh, nothing is kept from an earlier tick. The game pack
 * publishes it before every plugin loads and withdraws it after they unload, so the table stays
 * valid while your plugin is loaded. Check size before calling a function a later minor adds. */
